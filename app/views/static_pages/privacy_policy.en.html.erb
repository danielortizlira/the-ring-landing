<section class="mb-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-500 mb-3">4. Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?</h2>
  <p class="mb-2">
    We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to
    provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business
    obligations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal

  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 my-2">
    <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-500 mb-3">5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
    measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
    process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
    information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
    storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
    promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
    third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
    collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our
    best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
    information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access
    the App within a secure environment.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-500 mb-3">6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
    for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
    period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
    legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
    personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have
    an account with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
    information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
    this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
    been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
    possible.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-500 mb-3">7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p class="mb-2">
    In some regions (like the European Economic Area and the UK), you have
    certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the
    right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,
    (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing
    of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.
    In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
    processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use
    the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any
    request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you
    have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however
    that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
    withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information
    conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
